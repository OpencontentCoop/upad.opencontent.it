paradoxpdf
==========

ParadoxPDF is an eZ Publish (Legacy) extension that provides a simple way to export views in PDF format. 

It's platform independent, easy to use and performant.

How does it work ?
------------------
ParadoxPDF uses a java jar : paradoxpdf.jar built uppon [Flying Saucer](https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer). 
Flying saucer is An XML/XHTML/CSS 2.1 Rendrer that has a native PDF output.
Paradoxpdf.jar is a wrapper jar that can be used from command line. It contains all dependencies.
The original idea for using 'Flying Saucer' to generate pdf contents was published by Joshua Marinacci can be found
